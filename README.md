# QT21-Scorecard

You can use the live demo: http://www.qt21.eu/scorecard

Further documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/multidimensionalquality/qt21-scorecard/wiki).

## Installation Instructions

The installation instructions are targeted to users who know how to install a PHP application on a webserver. We assume that you have already installed

* A webserver with PHP and MySQL support (e.g. Apache Webserver)
* A MySQL server with one database
* Git

The example command line calls are written for Linux / Mac users. The process can be easily adapted to Windows systems.

### 1. Download sourcecodes

```
git clone https://github.com/multidimensionalquality/qt21-scorecard.git
```

### 2. Deploy Symfony 2 Application

The QT21 Scorecard was created using the Symfony Framework. To deploy it on a webserver you must follow the [official documentation of Symfony 2](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/deployment/tools.html
).

If you want to use Composer to install Symfony, you may do the following (in  qt21-scorecard/):

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --filename=composer
composer install
```

Note that php 5.4 or above is required. In a shared-host environment, this may require explicitly using the path to php 5.4 on your server.

Also, you must enable the PHP module pdo_mysql.  In some shared-host environments you may need to enable it in your site-specific php.ini and copy the php.ini file into the qt21-scorecard/ and qt21-scorecard/web directories.

### 3. Create database and add database settings

We assume you have already created a MySQL database. Create a new parameters file for your application:

```
cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml
```

And put your database settings (host, user, password, database) in `app/config/parameters.yml`.

Initialize the database with the following command:

```
php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

Now you have to run the MySQL commands defined in `data/issues.sql` on your database to import the issue definitions. The default database name in the `data/issues.sql` file is "scorecard". If your database name is different, you will need to edit this file accordingly.

### 4. Create super user

Register user via normal scorecard registration form. Then run the following command to promote this user to a super user:

```
php app/console scorecard:promote-superuser <<username>>
```

### 5. Publishing Changes

To publish changes you have made you should type the following:

```
php app/console assets:install --symlink
```
Note, that --symlink is optional and may not work on systems which do not support symlinks.

```
php app/console assetic:dump
```
```
php app/console cache:clear
```

Your changes should be visible after these commands.
